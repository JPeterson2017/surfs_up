# Surfs Up!
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate temperatures during the warmest and coldest months of the year to see if a surf and ice-cream shop business is sustainable, year-around.

## Results
  * June has a higher average temperature
  * The minimum temperature for both months, differs by 10 degrees
  * The maximum temperature for both months only differs slightly - by 2 degrees

## Summary
### High-Level Summary of Results 
Regardless of the time of year, the temperatures are extremely similar and do not differ much. If anything, December temperatures tend to slightly drop on occasion but those low temperatures are not the norm. 

### Two Additional Query Suggestions
  1. I would suggest creating a query that analyzes the preciptation levels alongside the temperatures
  2. Once the above-mentioned query is created, I would create a query that pulled in the temperature and precipation data for both December and June, 
     side by side in   one dataframe.
